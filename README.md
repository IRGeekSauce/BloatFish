<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IRGeekSauce/BloatFish/master/bloatfish.ico" alt="Icon">

<p>BloatFish is a Windows 10 Utility App that allows users to remove preinstalled Windows 10 apps, many of which are considered "bloatware."</p>
<p>The target platform for this app is x64.</p>
 <p>This app uses two libraries, which are the <a href="https://github.com/evanwon/WPFCustomMessageBox">WPF Custom Message Box</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/xceedsoftware/wpftoolkit">WPF Extended Toolkit</a> for the Busy Indicator.
  <p>More apps will be added in the future, as well as the ability to reinstall removed apps within the BloatFish application.</p>
